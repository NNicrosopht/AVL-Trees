# AVL-Trees
Balanced Binary Trees in C#

This .Net Assembly contains Finite Ordered Sets, Hash Sets, Linked Lists, Stacks and Dynamic Arrays.

The Array class is an industrial strength dynamic array class with events, sorting etc.

The sorting is achieved via the Stack class - which supports the non-recursive merge sort.

Many other features are freely available in I++ - which may be downloaded from Source Forge.
