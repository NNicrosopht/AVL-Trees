# AVL-Trees
Balanced Binary Trees in C#

This .Net Assembly contains Finite Ordered Sets, Hash Sets, Linked Lists, Stacks and Dynamic Arrays.

The Array class is an industrial strength dynamic array class with events, sorting etc.

The sorting is achieved via the Stack class - which supports the non-recursive merge sort.

Many other features are freely available in <a href=https://sourceforge.net/projects/iplusplus>I++</a>.

The Set Theory Assembly may also be obtained from <a href= http://sf.net/projects/avl-trees/>Source Forge</a>.


The Balancing Algorithms may be found in Utility.cs.

The Set class is the base class for AVL Trees. The Tree class derives from Set. A "Tree" is a "Set" with separate searches by the key class.

Sets support events. These events may be used to connect tree collections together.

Supporting documentation may be found at http://NNicrosopht.net/Html/English/Sets.
